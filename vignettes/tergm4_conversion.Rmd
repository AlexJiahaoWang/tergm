# Introduction #

Version 4.0 of the `tergm` package introduces new user interfaces for 
specifying `tergm` models.  While backwards compatibility has been maintained 
as much as possible, some users may wish to convert their code to use the new 
interfaces, and this document describes how to go about that in typical use 
cases.

# Estimation #

Typical estimation calls in `tergm` 3.x might look something like

```
data(samplk)
samp <- list(samplk1, samplk2, samplk3)
samp.fit <- stergm(samp,
                   formation = ~edges+mutual+cyclicalties+transitiveties,
                   dissolution = ~edges+mutual+cyclicalties+transitiveties,
                   estimate = "CMLE",
                   times = 1:3)
```
for CMLE, and
```
data(florentine)
stergm.fit.1 <- stergm(flobusiness,
                       formation = ~edges+gwesp(0,fixed=T),
                       dissolution = ~offset(edges),
                       targets = "formation",
                       offset.coef.diss = log(9),
                       estimate = "EGMME",
                       control = control.stergm(SA.plot.progress=TRUE))

```
for EGMME.

To convert these to the new 4.0 user interface, we make the following changes.

- Replace the function name `stergm` with `tergm` (in 4.0, the tergms need not 
  be separable, hence we drop the s).

- Combine the network (or network list), formation, and dissolution formulas 
  into a single formula, schematically of the form 

  ```
  network ~ Form(formation formula) + Persist(dissolution formula)
  ```

  where `Form` and `Persist` are operator terms defined in `tergm` 4.0.  For the 
  CMLE example, this would result in the formula 
  
  ```
  samp ~ Form(~edges+mutual+cyclicalties+transitiveties) + Persist(~edges+mutual+cyclicalties+transitiveties)
  ```
  
  and in the EGMME example, it would result in the formula 
  
  ```
  flobusiness ~ Form(~edges+gwesp(0,fixed=T)) + Persist(~offset(edges))
  ```
  
  These formulas will be our first arguments to the `tergm` function.

- The initial coefficient specifications for the formation and dissolution
  models, if passed, should be combined into a specification of initial
  coefficients for the combined model.  This can be done through the `tergm`
  function's `offset.coef` argument and/or `control$init` argument, with the 
  former overriding the corresponding elements of the latter.  If `offset.coef`
  is passed, it should have length equal to the number of offset thetas in the
  combined model, and if `control$init` is passed, it should have length equal
  to the total number of thetas in the combined model.  (`NA`s may be used in
  `control$init` to indicate that initial values for those (non-offset) thetas
  are not being passed.)  Here `control` refers to the `control.tergm` class 
  control discussed more below.

  In our examples, the CMLE call does not specify initial coefficient values, 
  and the EGMME call specifies only a single dissolution offset.  The result 
  is that we replace

  ```
  offset.coef.diss = log(9)
  ```

  with

  ```
  offset.coef = log(9)
  ```

  in the EGMME call.

- The control argument (if present), previously of class `control.stergm`, 
  should be replaced by one of class `control.tergm`.  This can be accomplished 
  by replacing `control.stergm()` with `control.tergm()`, `snctrl()`, or 
  `list()`, and updating arguments as follows.  Arguments to `control.stergm()` 
  occurring in pairs with `.form` and `.diss` in their names have been 
  collapsed to single, correspondingly named arguments to `control.tergm()` 
  without `.form` or `.diss`.  Additionally, the arguments `MCMC.init.maxedges` 
  and `MCMC.init.maxchanges` to `control.stergm()` have been replaced by the 
  `MCMC.maxedges` and `MCMC.maxchanges` arguments to `control.tergm()`.  In the 
  examples above, no such arguments are used, so the only change we need to 
  make is `control.stergm -> control.tergm` in the EGMME call.


Overall, this produces the new-style calls
```
data(samplk)
samp <- list(samplk1, samplk2, samplk3)
samp.fit <- tergm(samp ~ Form(~edges+mutual+cyclicalties+transitiveties) + 
                         Persist(~edges+mutual+cyclicalties+transitiveties),
                   estimate = "CMLE",
                   times = 1:3)
```
for CMLE, and
```
data(florentine)
tergm.fit.1 <- tergm(flobusiness ~ Form(~edges+gwesp(0,fixed=T)) + 
                                   Persist(~offset(edges)),
                     targets = "formation",
                     offset.coef = log(9),
                     estimate = "EGMME",
                     control = control.tergm(SA.plot.progress=TRUE))
```
for EGMME.


# Simulation #

## From a fitted `tergm` object ##

A typical call in `tergm` 3.x for simulating from a fitted `stergm` might look 
something like
```
stergm.sim.1 <- simulate(stergm.fit.1, 
                         nsim = 1,
                         time.slices = 1000)
```

To convert from simulating a fitted `stergm` in `tergm` 3.x to simulating a 
fitted `tergm` in `tergm` 4.0, we make the following changes.

- Replace the `coef.form` and `coef.diss` arguments (which will default to the 
  coefficients of the fitted `stergm`) with the `coef` argument (which will 
  default to the coefficients of the fitted `tergm`), which is schematically of 
  the form `coef = c(coef.form, coef.diss)`, assuming the combined formula used 
  when estimating the `tergm` was of the form described in the Estimation 
  section (with `Form(formation formula)` preceding 
  `Persist(dissolution formula)`).  These arguments are not passed in the example 
  above, so no corresponding changes are needed in that example.

- Replace the `stats.form` and `stats.diss` arguments (if passed) with the 
  `stats` argument.  These arguments are not passed in the example above, so 
  no corresponding changes are needed in that example.

- The control argument (if passed), previously of class 
  `control.simulate.stergm`, should be replaced by one of class 
  `control.simulate.tergm`.  This can be accomplished by replacing 
  `control.simulate.stergm()` with `control.simulate.tergm()`, `snctrl()`, or 
  `list()`, and updating arguments as follows.  Arguments to 
  `control.simulate.stergm()` occurring in pairs with `.form` and `.diss` in 
  their names have been collapsed to single, correspondingly named arguments to 
  `control.simulate.tergm()` without `.form` or `.diss`.  Additionally, the 
  arguments `MCMC.init.maxedges` and `MCMC.init.maxchanges` to 
  `control.simulate.stergm()` have been replaced by the `MCMC.maxedges` and 
  `MCMC.maxchanges` arguments to `control.simulate.tergm()`.  In the example 
  above, no control argument is passed, so no corresponding changes are needed 
  in that example.

Thus, the most we need to do to convert to a 4.0 style call for this example is 
to drop the s from the object names for consistency, yielding
```
tergm.sim.1 <- simulate(tergm.fit.1, 
                        nsim = 1,
                        time.slices = 1000)
```

## From a network (or networkDynamic) ##

A typical call in `tergm` 3.x for simulating based on a starting network (or 
networkDynamic), along with specified formation and dissolution formulas and 
coefficients, might look something like
```
stergm.sim.2 <- simulate(flobusiness, 
                         formation = ~edges+gwesp(0,fixed=T),
                         dissolution = ~edges, 
                         monitor = "all",
                         coef.form = c(-7.981749, 1.575780), 
                         coef.diss = log(99),
                         time.slices = 50000)
```

To convert from simulating based on a starting network in `tergm` 3.x to 
simulating based on a starting network in `tergm` 4.0, we make the following 
changes.

- Combine the network, formation, and dissolution formulas into a single 
  formula, as for estimation.

- Combine the `coef.form` and `coef.diss` arguments into a single `coef` 
  argument, as when simulating from a fitted `tergm` (with coefficients 
  specified).

- The control argument (if passed), previously of class 
  `control.simulate.network`, should be replaced by one of class 
  `control.simulate.formula.tergm`.  This can be accomplished by replacing 
  `control.simulate.network()` with `control.simulate.formula.tergm()`, 
  `snctrl()`, or `list()`, and updating arguments as when simulating from a 
  fitted `tergm`.

- Combine the `stats.form` and `stats.diss` arguments (if passed) into a 
  single `stats` argument.

- Pass `dynamic = TRUE` to indicate that you want `tergm` simulation 
  (otherwise, `ergm` simulation will be attempted instead).

Thus, we obtain the 4.0 simulation call
```
tergm.sim.2 <- simulate(flobusiness ~ Form(~edges+gwesp(0,fixed=T)) +
                                      Persist(~edges),
                        monitor = "all",
                        coef = c(-7.981749, 1.575780, log(99)), 
                        time.slices = 50000,
                        dynamic = TRUE)
```
